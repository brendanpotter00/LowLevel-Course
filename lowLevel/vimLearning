After taking Principles of Computer Science 1 last semester i have used vim alot
. One of the things i found most annoying was not knowing all the shortcuts to m
ove around easily like Dr. Lewis did, as we just brefly talked about how to use
vim. The vim tutorial was helpfull in teaching me many of these like 'A' to skip
 to the end of the line, which makes edditing code easier.
